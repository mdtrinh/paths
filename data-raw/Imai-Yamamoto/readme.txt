This replication archive contains datasets and R scripts for reproducing the figures and diagnostics results reported in Imai and Yamamoto, "Identification and Sensitivity Analysis for Multiple Causal Mechanisms: Revisiting Evidence from Framing Experiments."

The archive consists of the following files:

* readme.txt: This document

* fig2and3.R: Main R script for reproducing Figures 2 and 3

* PA-ImaiYamamoto.RData: R workspace image containing three datasets (named DruckNels, Slothuus and Brader) used in fig2and3.R

The R script in fig2and3.R outputs six pdf files, three of which (named medsens-indep-XXX.pdf) are the columns of Figure 2 and the rest (medsens-XXX.pdf) Figure 3. The script requires the "mediation" package version 4.1.2 or higher.

The datasets are subsets of the original data provided by the authors of the studies cited in the paper.
